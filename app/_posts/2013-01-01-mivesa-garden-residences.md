## Master Planned

Mivesa Garden Residences is a master-planned garden community, with integrated open spaces that cover 60% of a prime 1.8 hectare property located right in the MIddle of VEterans and SAlinas Drive.


This 3-phase project has a total of 7 mid-rise buildings ranging from 6-10 floors.

Pocket parks, amenities, pedestrian walkways and jogging paths are distributed throughout the development to create not only an attractive landscape but also an ideal venue for neighborhood-building, family-bonding and healthy-living.

## The Inspiration

Designed to outfit the needs of the active Cebuano, the amenities of modern urban living are set amidst a relaxing environment to make your own home your easy respite at the end of a long day.
