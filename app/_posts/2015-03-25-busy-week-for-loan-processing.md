title: A busy week for Loan Processing

categories: blog
---

Most of the projects we've been working on are now turning over to our clients. Some of which are in the coming months or two. That signals the start of processing their bank loans. I'm now contacting some of my clients to:

- inform and remind them about the good news. Their units are on its way and moving in will be closer.
- ask for some requirements for their bank loan application.

## Busy and Excited

It's an exciting time for most, the idea that the key to your home/unit will be given to you in the coming months is an exciting feeling. It's humbling that I am able to witness smiles I see when they hear the good news.
